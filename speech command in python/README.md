Hi this is an a simple app that resembles alexa or siri

the reason it is simple is because the dataset is not complete and need some work and other features can be added to be more effective.


firstly : this is my project using python that utilized first a transcribe function in the transcribe file to have some simple dataset to use
secondly : i used functions file to make first record audio in english and then compare it with data set and then offer a conversation
thirdly : it checks if the user says the word search if so it searches the web with whatever the user says after the search word and this is to make resemble alexa and siri
forthly : i made using kivy a mobile application where the user can click on the "talk" button and then speak the speech command according to what explained above.
